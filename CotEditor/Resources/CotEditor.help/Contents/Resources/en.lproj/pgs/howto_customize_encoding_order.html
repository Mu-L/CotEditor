<h1>Change priorities of text encodings in CotEditor on Mac</h1>

<p>CotEditor has a powerful text encoding detection feature that automatically determines the text encoding of the file when opening a document.</p>

<p>The priority of text encoding depends on the language and use case. So, you can prioritize specific encodings to detect text encoding of documents.</p>

<p>To change the priority of encoding detection on file opening:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Choose CotEditor &gt; Settings.</li>
	<li>Select the Format pane.</li>
	<li>In the “Priority of encodings” section, click the Edit List button.</li>
	<li>Move up the encodings you use frequently.</li>
</ol>

<p>Encodings not on this list are not considered as candidates for the automatic encoding detection when opening documents. Keep encodings on the list that you want to use as candidates for encoding detection, even if you do not use them directly.</p>

<p>“Unicode (UTF-8)” and “Unicode (UTF-8) with BOM” can not be removed from the list and are always handled as a set. Because the BOM (byte order mark) is taken into account when trying to encode data into UTF-8, there is no effect on the detection precision that the order of these two encodings is fixed.</p>

<p>“Unicode (UTF-16)” should be placed <strong>after</strong> other often-used encodings, because UTF-16 can encode most characters.</p>
